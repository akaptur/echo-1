This project contains a blocking TCP Echo Server and its corresponding client.  

The TCP Echo Server creates a socket bound to port 1060 of the specified
interface to listen for a connection request.  When it receives one, it accepts
it which creates a socket for communication between itself and the client. 
The server waits to receive a message which ends with an end of line
character (\n).  Then it echoes the message back to the client.  
When the server detects that the client has closed the socket, it closes the
socket as well and goes back to listening for a connection request. 

The TCP Echo Client opens a socket and connects to the server.  It reads lines 
of input from the user, sending each line as a message to the server and waiting
to receive its echo back.  When the user enters a period as the input line, the
client closes the socket and exits.

Invocation:

Server: python server.py [interface]
Client: python client.py host
